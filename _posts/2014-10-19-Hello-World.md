The easiest way to make your blogs is with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

I followed the instructions [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). 

For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository @ GitHub](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
